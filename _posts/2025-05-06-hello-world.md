## Welcome to Just Another Blog

### Hello world.

I've wanted to write for many years now, and while I have thousands of notes sprawling across 10+ online platforms, I've never ended up publishing anything. A couple of months ago, I quit my mechanical engineering job without any backup plan; a couple days ago, I enrolled in an immersive coding bootcamp - I'm sure you've heard LOTS of things about coding bootcamps, but odds are that you've never heard of this one. As I prepare for Fractal Tech's AI Accelerator, I've now learned enough basic web development that whipping up a personal blog has never been easier.

While my intention is to use this for documenting thoughts, insights, and musings along my software engineering journey, it's inevitable that I will end up writing about a whole host of other unrelated topics - along with longwinded attempts at connecting the seemingly unconnected instances to coding. Nonetheless, I hope you can get something out of this for yourself, whether you know me personally and care to follow along, or you're on your own learn-to-code journey and are able to learn something and/or contribute to the discussions and teach ME something new.
